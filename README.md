## Virgil
Virgil is a a minimalist C web browser primarily built for GNU/Linux systems. The internet may as well be prefaced with "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here," but having a good guide is always helpful.

Virgil is still in an early stage of development; it is currently missing fundamental features.

# Dependencies
Building Virgil specifically requires Gtk3 and GtkWebkit2. A few small modifications to the latter library may be required in order to run the build script.

# Why Virgil
Virgil will serve two purposes: 
1. Serve the role of a resource-lite, minimalist, and customizable GNU/Linux web browser, specficially for WM environments.
2. Serve as a project to refine my practice with the C programming language.
